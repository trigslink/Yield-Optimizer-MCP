# Yield Optimizer MCP

**Yield Optimizer MCP** is a headless, Dockerized Model Context Protocol (MCP) designed for use with [Trigslink](https://github.com/trigslink). It scans and analyzes top DeFi protocols to identify the best yield farming and staking opportunities, exposing structured data for consumption by agents, apps, or AI systems.

## Features

- Tracks real-time APYs across DeFi protocols
- Analyzes LPs, vaults, staking strategies
- Built for easy integration with Trigslink's decentralized MCP network
- Dockerized for instant deployment


## Architecture

Modular and AI-ready. This MCP emits context data about:

- Best current yield opportunities
- Protocol-specific strategies
- Risk-adjusted returns (if applicable)


## Deployment (via Docker)

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/Yield_Optimiser_mcp.git
cd Yield_Optimiser_mcp

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t yield-mcp .

# Run the MCP
docker run -p 8080:8080 yield-mcp
```
